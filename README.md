# Day-planner

Keegan Nair

this day planner allows a user to add tasks for a workday between 9 to 5.

when you enter a task into the input section. Click the save button and it will take that input into an array into your local storage, it will also be able to display it after you refresh it onto the text where a user would normally write.

color will be added in the future to represent the time of day, where red would be current time, grey would be time passed and green would be time in the future.
